## CorPy

A python scipt that helps me get coronavirus statics on the command line.Cause getting the data from a website can sometimes be slow and tedious.

# Build

Download the corona python file and make it an executable :

```

chmod u+x corona

```

Then run using the following command to execute :

```
./corona
```

Use "-c" argument to get info of a specific country :

```
./corona -c Russia
```
